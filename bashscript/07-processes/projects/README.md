### Project 3: Background Task Manager
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Advanced)

**Description**: Create a script that manages background tasks.

**Requirements**:
- Start tasks in background
- Track running tasks
- List active tasks
- Stop tasks
- Monitor task status

**Skills Practiced**:
- Background process management
- Task tracking
- Job control
- Process monitoring

**Time Estimate**: 60-75 minutes

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Read the project file**: Each project has a template with TODO comments
2. **Plan your solution**: Think about process management needed
3. **Implement step by step**: Complete one requirement at a time
4. **Test thoroughly**: Test with different processes and signals
5. **Refactor**: Clean up and improve your code

## ✅ Project Completion Checklist

For each project, ensure:
- [ ] Script has proper shebang and comments
- [ ] All requirements are met
- [ ] Signal handling is implemented
- [ ] Error handling is present
- [ ] Script is tested with various scenarios
- [ ] Cleanup is performed
- [ ] Code is readable and well-organized

## 💡 Tips

- **Always cleanup**: Use trap for cleanup on exit
- **Check processes**: Verify process status before operations
- **Handle signals**: Always handle common signals gracefully
- **Log events**: Log important process events
- **Test thoroughly**: Test signal handling and process management
- **Monitor resources**: Watch for resource leaks
