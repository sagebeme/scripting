# Exercises - Level 5: Control Flow

## 📝 How to Complete Exercises

1. **Read the exercise file**: Each exercise has comments explaining what to do
2. **Add your commands**: Replace comments with actual bash commands
3. **Make executable**: Run `chmod +x exercise-name.sh`
4. **Test your solution**: Run `./exercise-name.sh`
5. **Compare with solutions**: Check the `solutions/` directory (after attempting)

## 📋 Exercise List

### Exercise 1: Conditional Statements (`exercise-1-conditionals.sh`)
**Objective**: Master if/else statements
- Write if statements
- Use file tests
- Compare strings and numbers
- Nested conditionals
- Multiple conditions

**Time**: 25-30 minutes

### Exercise 2: Loops (`exercise-2-loops.sh`)
**Objective**: Implement various loop types
- For loops (list and C-style)
- While loops
- Until loops
- Nested loops
- Break and continue

**Time**: 30-35 minutes

### Exercise 3: Case Statements (`exercise-3-case.sh`)
**Objective**: Create case statements
- Simple case statements
- Multiple patterns
- Default cases
- Pattern matching
- Case in functions

**Time**: 20-25 minutes

## ✅ Completion Checklist

Before moving on, ensure you can:
- [ ] Write if/else statements
- [ ] Use test command and [ ]
- [ ] Create for, while, and until loops
- [ ] Use break and continue
- [ ] Create case statements
- [ ] Handle user input
- [ ] Complete all exercises without looking at solutions first

## 💡 Tips

- **Test conditions**: Verify your conditions work as expected
- **Practice loops**: Build different loop patterns
- **Use case**: Case is cleaner than multiple if/elif for multiple values
- **Break complex logic**: Use nested structures when needed
- **Test edge cases**: Test with empty inputs, boundaries, etc.

## 🚀 Next Steps

After completing all exercises:
1. Review your solutions
2. Practice with different scenarios
3. Build interactive scripts
4. Move to the Projects section
