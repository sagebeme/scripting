# Projects - Level 5: Control Flow

## 🎯 Project Overview

These projects will help you master control flow in real-world scripting scenarios.

## 📋 Project List

- Loop until user chooses to exit
- Use case statements

**Skills Practiced**:
- Menu creation
- User input handling
- Case statements
- Loops
- Input validation

**Time Estimate**: 45-60 minutes

### Project 2: File Processor with Conditions
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Intermediate)

**Description**: Create a script that processes files based on various conditions.

**Requirements**:
- Process files based on conditions
- Handle different file types
- Apply filters (size, age, type)
- Process files accordingly
- Generate reports

**Skills Practiced**:
- Conditional statements
- File tests
- Loops
- Filtering logic
- Report generation

**Time Estimate**: 45-60 minutes

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Read the project file**: Each project has a template with TODO comments
2. **Plan your solution**: Think about control flow structures needed
3. **Implement step by step**: Complete one requirement at a time
4. **Test thoroughly**: Test with different inputs and scenarios
5. **Refactor**: Clean up and improve your code

## ✅ Project Completion Checklist

For each project, ensure:
- [ ] Script has proper shebang and comments
- [ ] All requirements are met
- [ ] Control flow is used effectively
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Input validation is present
- [ ] Script is tested with various inputs
- [ ] Output is clear and helpful
- [ ] Code is readable and well-organized

## 💡 Tips

- **Plan structure**: Think about control flow before coding
- **Use appropriate constructs**: Choose if/case/loops wisely
- **Validate input**: Always validate user input
- **Handle errors**: Check conditions before operations
- **Test edge cases**: Test with empty inputs, boundaries
- **Keep it simple**: Don't overcomplicate control flow
