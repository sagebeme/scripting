# Exercises - Level 3: Redirections

## 📝 How to Complete Exercises

1. **Read the exercise file**: Each exercise has comments explaining what to do
2. **Add your commands**: Replace comments with actual bash commands
3. **Make executable**: Run `chmod +x exercise-name.sh`
4. **Test your solution**: Run `./exercise-name.sh`
5. **Compare with solutions**: Check the `solutions/` directory (after attempting)

## 📋 Exercise List

### Exercise 1: Basic Redirections (`exercise-1-basic-redirections.sh`)
**Objective**: Master output and input redirection
- Redirect stdout to files
- Append to files
- Redirect stderr
- Combine stdout and stderr
- Use /dev/null
- Input redirection

**Time**: 20-25 minutes

### Exercise 2: Pipes and Filters (`exercise-2-pipes.sh`)
**Objective**: Chain commands with pipes and use filters
- Use pipes to connect commands
- Apply filters (grep, sort, uniq, wc)
- Chain multiple commands
- Count and filter data

**Time**: 25-30 minutes

### Exercise 3: Here Documents (`exercise-3-here-doc.sh`)
**Objective**: Use here documents and here strings
- Create files with here documents
- Feed input to commands
- Use variable expansion in here docs
- Use here strings (<<<)

**Time**: 20-25 minutes

### Exercise 4: tee Command (`exercise-4-tee.sh`)
**Objective**: Use tee to save and display output
- Display and save simultaneously
- Append with tee
- Use tee in pipelines
- Save to multiple files

**Time**: 15-20 minutes

## ✅ Completion Checklist

Before moving on, ensure you can:
- [ ] Redirect output and input
- [ ] Handle errors with redirection
- [ ] Chain commands with pipes
- [ ] Use common filters effectively
- [ ] Create here documents
- [ ] Use tee command
- [ ] Combine multiple redirections
- [ ] Complete all exercises without looking at solutions first

## 💡 Tips

- **Understand streams**: Know stdin, stdout, stderr
- **Practice combinations**: Try different redirection combinations
- **Use filters**: Master grep, sort, uniq, wc, cut
- **Test pipelines**: Build complex data processing pipelines
- **Error handling**: Always consider error redirection

## 🚀 Next Steps

After completing all exercises:
1. Review your solutions
2. Build your own pipelines
3. Practice with real data
4. Move to the Projects section
