**Requirements**:
- Read data from files
- Extract columns
- Filter data
- Sort and process
- Transform formats
- Output to files
- Display statistics

**Skills Practiced**:
- Input/output redirection
- Pipe chaining

### Project 3: Error Handling Script
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ (Beginner-Intermediate)

**Description**: Create a script that properly handles errors and logging.

**Requirements**:
- Capture stdout and stderr
- Log errors to files
- Display success messages
- Handle different error scenarios
- Generate error reports
- Use proper redirection

**Skills Practiced**:
- Error redirection
- Logging
- Error handling
- Report generation
- Stream management

**Time Estimate**: 30-45 minutes

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Read the project file**: Each project has a template with TODO comments
2. **Plan your solution**: Think about what commands and redirections you need
3. **Implement step by step**: Complete one requirement at a time
4. **Test thoroughly**: Test with different data and error scenarios
5. **Refactor**: Clean up and improve your code

## ✅ Project Completion Checklist

For each project, ensure:
- [ ] Script has proper shebang and comments
- [ ] All requirements are met
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Script is tested with various inputs
- [ ] Output is clear and helpful
- [ ] Pipes and redirections are used effectively
- [ ] Code is readable and well-organized

## 💡 Tips

- **Master filters**: Learn grep, awk, sed, sort, uniq well
- **Chain commands**: Build complex pipelines
- **Handle errors**: Always redirect stderr appropriately
- **Test pipelines**: Test each part of a pipeline separately
- **Use tee**: When you need to see and save output
- **Practice**: Build your own data processing pipelines
