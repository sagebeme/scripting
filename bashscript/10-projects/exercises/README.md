# Exercises - Level 10: Real-World Projects

## 📝 How to Complete Exercises

These exercises prepare you for the capstone projects by practicing key concepts.

1. **Read the exercise file**: Each exercise has comments explaining what to do
2. **Add your commands**: Replace comments with actual bash commands
3. **Make executable**: Run `chmod +x exercise-name.sh`
4. **Test your solution**: Run `./exercise-name.sh`
5. **Compare with solutions**: Check the `solutions/` directory (after attempting)
