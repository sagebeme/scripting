# Solutions - Level 1: Basics

## 📝 About Solutions

This directory contains reference solutions for the exercises and projects. 

**Important**: 
- Try to solve exercises and projects on your own first
- Only look at solutions after attempting
- Solutions are examples - there are multiple ways to solve problems
- Compare your approach with the solutions to learn different techniques

## 🎯 Learning Approach

1. **Attempt First**: Try solving without looking at solutions
2. **Get Stuck?**: Review the relevant topic in the README
3. **Still Stuck?**: Look at the solution, understand it, then rewrite it yourself
4. **Compare**: See how your solution differs and learn from both

## 📋 Solution Files

Solutions will be added here as you progress. Focus on understanding the concepts rather than just copying code.

## 💡 Remember

- There's no single "correct" solution
- Your solution might be different but still correct
- Focus on understanding why solutions work
- Practice explaining solutions to others
