# Exercise 5: Optimization
# Complete the tasks below by adding the appropriate commands

# Task 1: Avoid unnecessary subshells
# Instead of: result=$(command)
# Use more efficient method when possible
# Add optimized code here:


# Task 2: Use built-in commands instead of external
# Use bash built-ins when available
# Example: use [[ instead of [ when possible
# Add optimized code here:


# Task 3: Minimize file operations
# Read file once instead of multiple times
# Add optimized code here:


# Task 4: Use arrays instead of repeated commands
# Store command output in array
# Add optimized code here:


# Task 5: Avoid unnecessary loops
# Use efficient methods
# Add optimized code here:


# Task 6: Use here documents efficiently
# Avoid creating temporary files
# Add optimized code here:


# Task 7: Optimize string operations
# Use efficient string methods
# Add optimized code here:


# Task 8: Profile script execution
# Measure execution time
# Add profiling code here:


# Task 9: Optimize regex usage
# Use efficient patterns
# Add optimized code here:


# Task 10: Review and optimize
# Identify bottlenecks
# Add optimization notes here (as comments):
