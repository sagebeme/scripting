# Exercises - Level 4: Object-Oriented Programming

## 📝 How to Complete Exercises

1. **Read the exercise file**: Each exercise has comments explaining what to do
2. **Add your code**: Replace comments with actual Python code
3. **Run the script**: Execute `python3 exercise-name.py`
4. **Test your solution**: Verify output matches expectations
5. **Compare with solutions**: Check the `solutions/` directory (after attempting)

## 📋 Exercise List

- Create parent and child classes
- Override methods
- Use super()
- Understand method resolution

**Time**: 30-35 minutes

### Exercise 3: Special Methods (`exercise-3-special-methods.py`)
**Objective**: Implement special methods
- Implement __init__, __str__, __repr__
- Operator overloading
- Custom behavior
- Context managers

**Time**: 35-40 minutes

### Exercise 4: Properties (`exercise-4-properties.py`)
**Objective**: Use property decorators

**Time**: 40-45 minutes

## ✅ Completion Checklist

Before moving on, ensure you can:
- [ ] Define classes and create objects
- [ ] Use inheritance
- [ ] Implement special methods
- [ ] Use properties
- [ ] Apply design patterns
- [ ] Complete all exercises without looking at solutions first

## 💡 Tips

- **Understand self**: Always use self for instance methods
- **Use super()**: Call parent methods properly
- **Special methods**: Learn common special methods
- **Properties**: Use when you need computed attributes
- **Design patterns**: Use when they solve real problems

## 🚀 Next Steps

After completing all exercises:
1. Review your solutions
2. Practice with more complex classes
3. Apply OOP to real problems
4. Move to the Projects section
