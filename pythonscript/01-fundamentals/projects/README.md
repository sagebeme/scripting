## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Read the project file**: Each project has a template with TODO comments
2. **Plan your solution**: Think about what code you need
3. **Implement step by step**: Complete one requirement at a time
4. **Test thoroughly**: Test with different inputs and edge cases
5. **Refactor**: Clean up and improve your code

## ✅ Project Completion Checklist

For each project, ensure:
- [ ] Script has proper shebang and docstring
- [ ] All requirements are met
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Script is tested with various inputs
- [ ] Output is clear and helpful
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 style
- [ ] Code is readable and well-organized

## 💡 Tips

- **Start simple**: Get basic functionality working first
- **Test incrementally**: Test after each major feature
- **Handle errors**: Check for invalid input, division by zero, etc.
- **Use functions**: Break code into logical functions
- **Add comments**: Explain complex logic
- **Test edge cases**: Empty input, invalid choices, etc.
