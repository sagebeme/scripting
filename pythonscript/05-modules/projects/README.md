## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Read the project file**: Each project has a template with TODO comments
2. **Plan your solution**: Think about file operations needed
3. **Implement step by step**: Complete one requirement at a time
4. **Test thoroughly**: Test with different files and scenarios
5. **Refactor**: Clean up and improve your code

## ✅ Project Completion Checklist

For each project, ensure:
- [ ] Script has proper shebang and docstring
- [ ] All requirements are met
- [ ] File operations use context managers
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Script is tested with various inputs
- [ ] Output is clear and helpful
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 style
- [ ] Code is readable and well-organized

## 💡 Tips

- **Use context managers**: Always use `with` for file operations
- **Handle errors**: Files might not exist or be inaccessible
- **Use pathlib**: Modern way to handle paths
- **Test with sample files**: Create test files to practice
- **Validate input**: Check file existence and format
- **Backup data**: Consider backing up before modifying files
