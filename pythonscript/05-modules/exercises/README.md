# Exercises - 05 Modules

## 📝 How to Complete Exercises

1. **Read the exercise file**: Each exercise has comments explaining what to do
2. **Add your code**: Replace comments with actual Python code
3. **Run the script**: Execute `python3 exercise-name.py`
4. **Test your solution**: Verify output matches expectations
5. **Compare with solutions**: Check the `solutions/` directory (after attempting)

## ✅ Completion Checklist

Before moving on, ensure you can:
- [ ] Read and write files
- [ ] Use context managers
- [ ] Work with CSV files
- [ ] Handle JSON data
- [ ] Use pathlib
- [ ] Work with directories
- [ ] Handle file errors
- [ ] Complete all exercises without looking at solutions first

## 💡 Tips

- **Use context managers**: Always use `with` for file operations
- **Handle errors**: Files might not exist or be inaccessible
- **Use pathlib**: Modern way to handle paths
- **Test with real files**: Create test files to practice
- **Check file existence**: Always verify files exist before operations

## 🚀 Next Steps

After completing all exercises:
1. Review your solutions
2. Practice with different file formats
3. Try working with larger files
4. Move to the Projects section
