"""

# Task 1: Create a list with numbers 1 to 10
# Add your code here:


# Task 2: Use list comprehension to create squares of numbers 1-10
# Add your code here:


# Task 3: Use list comprehension with condition (even numbers only)
# Add your code here:


# Task 4: Create nested list (3x3 matrix)
# Add your code here:


# Task 5: Flatten a nested list
# Example: [[1,2], [3,4]] -> [1,2,3,4]
nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
# Add your code here:


# Task 6: Remove duplicates from a list
# Use set or list comprehension
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5]
# Add your code here:


# Task 7: Find common elements in two lists
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# Add your code here:


# Task 8: Sort a list of tuples by second element
data = [('apple', 5), ('banana', 2), ('cherry', 8)]
# Add your code here:


# Task 9: Group list elements by condition
# Group numbers into even and odd
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# Add your code here:


# Task 10: Create list of lists using comprehension
# Create multiplication table (1x1 to 5x5)
# Add your code here:
