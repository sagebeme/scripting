# Exercises - Level 2: Data Structures

## 📝 How to Complete Exercises

1. **Read the exercise file**: Each exercise has comments explaining what to do
2. **Add your code**: Replace comments with actual Python code
3. **Run the script**: Execute `python3 exercise-name.py`
4. **Test your solution**: Verify output matches expectations
5. **Compare with solutions**: Check the `solutions/` directory (after attempting)

## ✅ Completion Checklist

Before moving on, ensure you can:
- [ ] Use list and dictionary comprehensions
- [ ] Work with nested data structures
- [ ] Use sets and tuples effectively
- [ ] Apply collections module utilities
- [ ] Create generators
- [ ] Understand iterator protocol
- [ ] Complete all exercises without looking at solutions first

## 💡 Tips

- **Use comprehensions**: More Pythonic and often faster
- **Choose right structure**: Lists for order, dicts for lookup, sets for uniqueness
- **Master generators**: Essential for memory efficiency
- **Learn collections**: Powerful utilities for common tasks
- **Practice nesting**: Real-world data is often nested

## 🚀 Next Steps
