Exercise 3: Sets and Tuples
Complete the tasks below by adding the appropriate code
"""

# Task 1: Create a set with numbers
# Add your code here:


# Task 2: Add and remove items from set
numbers = {1, 2, 3}
# Add 4, remove 2
# Add your code here:


# Task 3: Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
# Find union, intersection, difference
# Add your code here:


# Task 4: Create a tuple
# Add your code here:


# Task 5: Tuple unpacking
coordinates = (10, 20)
# Unpack into x and y variables
# Add your code here:


# Task 6: Named tuple
from collections import namedtuple
# Create a Point namedtuple with x and y
# Add your code here:


# Task 7: Use set to remove duplicates from list
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5]
# Add your code here:


# Task 8: Check if sets are subsets
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# Check if set1 is subset of set2
# Add your code here:


# Task 9: Create set comprehension
# Set of squares for numbers 1-10
# Add your code here:


# Task 10: Multiple assignment with tuples
# Swap two variables using tuple unpacking
a = 10
b = 20
# Add your code here:
