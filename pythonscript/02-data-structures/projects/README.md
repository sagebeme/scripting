## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Read the project file**: Each project has a template with TODO comments
2. **Plan your solution**: Think about data structures needed
3. **Implement step by step**: Complete one requirement at a time
4. **Test thoroughly**: Test with different data and scenarios
5. **Refactor**: Clean up and improve your code

## ✅ Project Completion Checklist

For each project, ensure:
- [ ] Script has proper shebang and docstring
- [ ] All requirements are met
- [ ] Appropriate data structures are used
- [ ] Code is efficient and Pythonic
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Script is tested with various inputs
- [ ] Output is clear and helpful
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 style

## 💡 Tips

- **Choose right structure**: Dicts for key-value, lists for order, sets for uniqueness
- **Use comprehensions**: More Pythonic and efficient
- **Think about nesting**: Real data is often nested
- **Consider performance**: Understand time complexity
- **Test edge cases**: Empty data, single items, etc.
- **Document**: Add docstrings to functions
